## Project Name: Week 3 Project 01 – Personal Introduction HTML Page

### Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to accomplish three specific tasks:
1. Demonstrate that I can control the scope of a project by creating a scope plan
before initiating work, which keeps me focused and prevents deviation from the task
at hand. The *Unofficial Project Manager* warns that without a clear scope
statement, projects can “go around in circles and get smothered by scope creep”
when expectations are not clarified up front.
2. Reinforce my ability to use basic HTML tagging by creating a simple `index.html`
webpage.
3. Strengthen my ability to work in Markdown to produce documents that can be
published electronically on the web and used across multiple platforms.

### Description
This project will be developed using Visual Studio Code and submitted as two files
named exactly `scope.md` and `index.html`.

- **scope.md**: A complete scope statement written in Markdown, aligned with the
Chapter 3 template from *Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager*.

- **index.html**: A valid HTML page introducing me to the class with a short
biography. It will include:
- `<title>` element in the `<head>`
- `<h1>` with my name (John E. Barkle IV)
- `<h2>` with my major (BS in Computing Applications) and professional interest
(Program/Project Management and AI Integration)
- Two `<p>` paragraphs (one describing my course goals, one describing my career
goals)
- An unordered `<ul>` list with at least three hobbies or interests (e.g., AI
projects, electronics troubleshooting, mentoring and team development)
- A clickable `<a>` link to my GitHub profile (https://github.com/JASYTIONLINE)

### Desired Results
- Meet all rubric requirements at the Exemplary level
- `scope.md` is complete, thoughtful, and clearly written using the Chapter 3
template.
- `index.html` is well-structured, cleanly indented, and includes all required
elements.
- The webpage provides a professional, accurate introduction of myself to the
class.

### Exclusions
- No CSS or additional styling beyond default browser rendering.
- No JavaScript or interactivity.
- No images, multimedia, or external frameworks.
- No hosting or live deployment.
- No extra sections beyond `scope.md` and `index.html`.

### Priorities
1. **Scope**: Requirements and rubric alignment are the highest priority; no extras
beyond the specified elements.
2. **Quality**: Both files are correctly named, professionally formatted, and free
of errors.
3. **Time**: Submission by Sunday, Aug 31, 2025, 11:59 pm (target Sat, Aug 30,
2025).
4. **Cost**: Not applicable for this academic project.
### Acceptance Criteria
- `scope.md` includes all seven required sections: Project Name, Purpose,
Description, Desired Results, Exclusions, Priorities, and Acceptance Criteria.
- `index.html` contains all six required elements: `<title>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, two
`<p>` paragraphs, `<ul>` with ≥3 `<li>`, and a clickable `<a>` link.
- Both files are correctly named and submitted on time.
- Work reflects thoughtful, professional effort and aligns fully with rubric
“Exemplary” standards.
