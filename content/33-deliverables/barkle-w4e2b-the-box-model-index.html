  <p>
     I’m taking CMPA 3301 – Fundamentals of Computing Applications as the entry point into my pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Computing Applications. This course introduces the core practices, theories, and technologies of computing applications, but what I find most interesting is its foundation in the principles of project management. I see it as a building block for both my academic journey and my long-term professional goals. It gives me the opportunity to connect emerging technologies with the project management principles that are central to how I organize my life and work.

    One thing about me is that I tend to overengineer everything I do. I was
    even tempted to comment out headers in the HTML with  < !-- comments out tags -- > tags in this HTML
    file, but I decided not to because I didn’t include that in my scope
    statement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking ahead, I plan to leverage my leadership and operations experience
    in the Texas Army National Guard to transition into IT and program
    management roles focused on AI integration, cybersecurity-aware operations,
    and risk reduction. I enjoy building capable teams, modernizing processes,
    and delivering reliable, secure systems for mission-critical environments.
