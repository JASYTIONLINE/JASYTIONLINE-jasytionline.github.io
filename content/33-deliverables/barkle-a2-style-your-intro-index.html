      I'm taking CMPA 3301 – Fundamentals of Computing Applications as the entry point
      into my pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Computing Applications. This course introduces
      the core practices, theories, and technologies of computing applications, but what I find
      most interesting is its foundation in the principles of project management.

      One thing about me is that I tend to overengineer everything I do. I was
      even tempted to comment out headers in the origional project HTML using `<!-- -->` tags,
      but I didn’t include that in my scope statement.

    <h2>But Now:</h2>
     <p>
         The boss gave us permission to make this our own page, so I am ramping things up a but.
         I have dug intothe MDN Web pages a little deeper and found a cool few little tricks like 
         "Center" to make my name centered in the banner on top of the page.

      Looking ahead, I plan to leverage my leadership and operations experience in the
      Texas Army National Guard to transition into IT and program management roles focused
      on AI integration, cybersecurity-aware operations, and risk reduction.
