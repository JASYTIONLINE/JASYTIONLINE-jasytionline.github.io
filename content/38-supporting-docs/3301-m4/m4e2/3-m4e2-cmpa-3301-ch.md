# ch-m4-cmpa-3301

## Purpose / Justification
Formally authorizes Module 4 to proceed to planning and execution in order to meet course outcomes for presenting digital information and applying PMI-aligned project management practices.

## Objectives
- Complete required readings and integrate insights into graded deliverables.  
- Submit Discussion 04 (initial + two replies) on time and per rubric.  
- Deliver Exercise 01 and Exercise 02 per rubric and deadlines.  
- Maintain a Risk/Assumptions/Issues Log (RAIL) during execution and control.  
- Close the module with a retrospective and Lessons Learned.

## High-Level Requirements
- Correct application of CSS concepts (palette selection and box model).  
- Discussion and exercises align with published rubrics.  
- Evidence of risk planning and control actions.  
- On-time LMS submissions.

## High-Level Scope
**In Scope:** Readings; Discussion 04; Exercises 01 & 02; RAIL; Retrospective; Lessons Learned.  
**Out of Scope:** Extra-credit items; full site builds beyond module requirements.

## Milestones
- 09/03/2025 — Initial discussion post submitted  
- 09/07/2025 — Exercises 01 & 02 due  
- End of Week 4 — Retrospective and Lessons Learned logged

## Assumptions
- LMS access remains available for submissions and discussion.  
- Peer/instructor engagement occurs through the forum.  
- 10–12 hours total effort is sufficient within the module week.

## Constraints
- Fixed syllabus deadlines.  
- Individual work only.  
- Tools limited to course-approved environments.

## High-Level Risks
- Compressed timeline across multiple deliverables.  
- CSS or submission platform issues.  
- Missed replies leading to partial credit.

## Stakeholders
- **Customer:** CMPA 3301 Instructor  
- **Project Manager:** Student  
- **Beneficiary:** Student’s academic progress

## Project Approval Requirements
- All deliverables submitted by deadlines and accepted in LMS.  
- Rubric criteria (mini-QMPs) met for each graded item.

## Project Manager Authority Level
Authorized to plan and execute within this chartered scope, allocate personal time/resources, and update controlling artifacts (e.g., workflow, PMP, RAIL) as needed to meet objectives.
