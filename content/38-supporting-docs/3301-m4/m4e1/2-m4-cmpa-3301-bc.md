## Executive Summary
The Module 4 project will deliver completed readings, exercises, and discussion participation that demonstrate the ability to present digital information effectively using CSS and to apply project-management concepts (especially risk planning). This work is necessary to meet course learning objectives and maintain academic progress in CMPA 3301.

## Problem / Opportunity Statement
If Module 4 is not completed, required outcomes and up to 60 points will be missed, risking course performance. Completing the module reinforces prior knowledge from Module 3, expands CSS skills (palette selection and the box model), and exercises risk-management thinking.

## Options Analysis
**Option 1 — Do Nothing**  
*Impact:* No points earned; no progress; risk of course failure.

**Option 2 — Partial Completion**  
*Impact:* Some points earned, but failure to meet full requirements; grade penalties likely.

**Option 3 — Full Completion (Recommended)**  
*Impact:* All assignments, readings, and discussion deliverables completed for full point opportunity; skills reinforced.

## Expected Benefits
- **Academic:** Up to 60 points toward the course grade.  
- **Knowledge:** Practical application of CSS presentation and box-model fundamentals.  
- **Professional:** Hands-on practice planning for risk using PMI-aligned methods.  
- **Strategic:** Maintains trajectory toward successful completion of CMPA 3301.

## Costs
- **Time:** Approximately 10–12 hours of focused work within Sep 1–7.  
- **Resources:** Access to LMS, readings, discussion forums, and a standard web toolchain (browser + editor).  
- **Financial:** No incremental costs beyond tuition.

## Risks
- **Time Compression:** Multiple graded items due within one week.  
- **Technical Issues:** Potential CSS or submission platform problems.  
- **Engagement:** Missing the required discussion replies reduces available points.

## Recommendation
Proceed with **Option 3: Full Completion**. Allocate adequate time, implement risk responses early, and submit all deliverables by their deadlines to realize academic and professional benefits.
