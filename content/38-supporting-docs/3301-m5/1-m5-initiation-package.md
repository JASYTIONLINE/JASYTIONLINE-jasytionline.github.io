# 1-M5-Initiation-Package.md

## Summary
This document consolidates PMI artifacts **#1 Project Charter, #2 Stakeholder Register, and #3 Requirements Documentation**. These are grouped because in a one-week, solo academic project, initiation can be captured in a single record without creating three separate files. This package authorizes the project, identifies stakeholders, and documents the requirements as inputs for planning. It should be read first, as it establishes the foundation for all subsequent packages.
