# Week 05: Overview 
What to expect this week

This week, we complete our foundational technical workflow by putting your project on the web for all to see. You will learn how to use Git and GitHub Desktop to manage versions of your project—a critical skill for any collaborative work—and publish it to a live, public URL. This hands-on work aligns directly with Chapter 5 of PMUPM, "Engaging the Team," as we explore how modern tools facilitate communication, accountability, and a shared understanding necessary for effective teamwork. Your major deliverable is Project 02, which synthesizes all your work so far into a single, professional repository.

Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this week, you will be able to:

Explain how version control systems like Git support the project management principle of "engaging the team" (SLO-5).
Use a graphical user interface (GitHub Desktop) to commit changes to a local repository and push those changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com (SLO-4).
Create and publish a basic, live website using GitHub Pages (SLO-4).
Structure a project repository in a clean, professional manner, including a descriptive README file (SLO-4).

Chapter 5 of Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager is titled "Engaging the Team." The central challenge for any project manager is to inspire "shared accountability." This week, we move our work onto GitHub, a platform designed for exactly that. Try to think of it less as a technical tool and more as a communication platform. Every action you take is a form of communication.

"But the principle of accountability is simple: When you keep your commitments, you become a trustworthy human being. You gain the trust of your team members, who will be encouraged to keep their commitments as well."

—Kogon, CH 5

A commit is a snapshot of your files at a specific point in time.

It's like pressing "Save" in a video game, but with a crucial difference: you are required to write a commit message explaining what you did and why. A history of clear commit messages is a transparent log of the project's entire history. It shows you kept your commitments.

A branch is a parallel version of your repository.

It lets you experiment with a new feature or idea (like a new page design or a different color scheme) without any risk of breaking the main project. If the experiment doesn't work, you can simply delete the branch. If it does, you can merge it back into the main project. This is a powerful tool for encouraging innovation while managing risk.

While you will be working solo on your projects in this course, it is important to understand the most critical collaborative feature of GitHub: the Pull Request (PR). A pull request is a formal way of saying, "I have completed the work on my branch, and I believe it is ready to be merged into the main project. Please review it."

This is the heart of team engagement on GitHub. It is a formal moment for feedback, discussion, and quality control. It is the technical foundation for the "cadence of accountability" and "Team Accountability Sessions" discussed in PMUPM, creating a clear process for reviewing work and keeping the project moving forward.
