# 2-M5-Scope-and-Planning.md

## Summary
This document consolidates PMI artifacts **#4 Scope Statement, #5 Scope Baseline (including WBS and WBS Dictionary), and #6–7 Activity List & Attributes**. These outputs are combined here because, in a one-week solo academic project, scope definition and task breakdown naturally flow together. This package establishes *what needs to be done* and *how tasks connect*. It should be read in parallel with **3-M5-Schedule-Package.md**, which sequences these tasks into a timeline with milestones and a checklist for execution.

---

## 4. Scope Statement
The scope of Week 05 includes:
- Assigned readings with annotated notes.  
- Discussion post (initial) and replies.  
- Exercises to practice GitHub workflows.  
- Major deliverable: Project 02, consisting of a public GitHub repository, a professional README.md, index.html, style.css, and a live website published through GitHub Pages.  

**Out of scope:** Any work not explicitly tied to Week 05 requirements, additional coding projects, or extracurricular deliverables.
