# Pull Requests: The Formal Review

While you will be working solo on your projects in this course, it is important to understand the most critical collaborative feature of GitHub: the Pull Request (PR). A pull request is a formal way of saying, "I have completed the work on my branch, and I believe it is ready to be merged into the main project. Please review it."

This is the heart of team engagement on GitHub. It is a formal moment for feedback, discussion, and quality control. It is the technical foundation for the "cadence of accountability" and "Team Accountability Sessions" discussed in PMUPM, creating a clear process for reviewing work and keeping the project moving forward.

#### See About pull requests - GitHub DocsLinks to an external site. to learn more.

About pull requests
Learn about pull requests and draft pull requests on GitHub. Pull requests communicate changes to a branch in a repository. Once a pull request is opened, you can review changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits.

About pull requests
A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase. Pull requests display the differences, or diffs, between the content in the source branch and the content in the target branch.

Note

### When working with pull requests, keep the following in mind:

If you're working in the shared repository model, we recommend that you use a topic branch for your pull request. While you can send pull requests from any branch or commit, with a topic branch you can push follow-up commits if you need to update your proposed changes.
Be very careful when force pushing commits to a pull request. Force pushing changes the repository history and can corrupt your pull request. If other collaborators branch the project before a force push, the force push may overwrite commits that collaborators based their work on.
You can create pull requests on GitHub.com, with GitHub Desktop, in GitHub Codespaces, on GitHub Mobile, and when using GitHub CLI.

After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or teams. See Creating a pull request.

Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the "Files changed" tab.

Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request. By default, in public repositories, any user can submit reviews that approve or request changes to a pull request. Organization owners and repository admins can limit who is able to give approving pull request reviews or request changes. For more information, see Managing pull request reviews in your organization and Managing pull request reviews in your repository.

You can see information about the branch's current deployment status and past deployment activity on the "Conversation" tab. See Viewing deployment activity for your repository.

After you're happy with the proposed changes, you can merge the pull request. If you're working in a shared repository model, you create a pull request and you, or someone else, will merge your changes from your feature branch into the base branch you specify in your pull request. See Merging a pull request.

If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch. For more information, see About protected branches.

You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. For more information, see Linking a pull request to an issue.

Tip

To toggle between collapsing and expanding all outdated review comments in a pull request, hold down Alt and click Show outdated or Hide outdated. For more shortcuts, see Keyboard shortcuts.
You can squash commits when merging a pull request to gain a more streamlined view of changes. See About pull request merges.
You can visit your dashboard to quickly find links to recently updated pull requests you're working on or subscribed to. See Quickstart for your personal dashboard.

Draft pull requests
When you create a pull request, you can choose to create a pull request that is ready for review or a draft pull request. Draft pull requests cannot be merged, and code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests. See Creating a pull request and Creating a pull request from a fork.

When you're ready to get feedback on your pull request, you can mark your draft pull request as ready for review. Marking a pull request as ready for review will request reviews from any code owners. You can convert a pull request to a draft at any time. See Changing the stage of a pull request.

Differences between commits on compare and pull request pages
The compare and pull request pages use different methods to calculate the diff for changed files:

Compare pages show the diff between the tip of the head ref and the current common ancestor (that is, the merge base) of the head and base ref.
Pull request pages show the diff between the tip of the head ref and the common ancestor of the head and base ref at the time when the pull request was created. Consequently, the merge base used for the comparison might be different.

## Discussion 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help
Discussion 05: Title
 

star.pngDiscussion Prompt
 

Chapter 5 of PMUPM and this week's content focus on engaging people and maintaining accountability. GitHub is a tool designed to help with this, especially by providing a clear history of a project through version control.

 

Describe a time a digital project (at work, school, or home) suffered because of poor communication or version control.
Examples:
"Which file is the real final version?"
"final_final_v2_USE_THIS_ONE.docx"
"Who changed this paragraph?!"
losing work because of software or a computer crash

How could a tool like GitHub, combined with a principle from Chapter 5 (like establishing a "cadence of accountability"), have helped prevent the problem?

Week 05: Discussion 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help- Alesha Sulahry

As someone who loved Notion and uses it to organize many aspects of her life, I was set on using it for my business with my friends. I convinced them when I showed them my pages, and we were set on fully planning out our business there. We created pages and subpages for brainstorming, marketing, research, and budgeting. Everyone was given full access, and with our different specialties we felt like it would be a very successful/ helpful planning and documenting page. As time went on though, we ran into a couple of issues because we of course weren't able to communicate upfront at all times, so at certain points we would jump on the same pages and make big changes or delete others work on accident. A few days into making the pages one of my friends accidently deleted the budgeting page, which was a super important page which a LOT of work was put into it. This slowed us down, and because we did not realize till later, we couldn't revive it.

Now knowing what GitHub is, I do feel like this would've been helpful for our situation, because it is able to track every single change, big or small. Being able to see all the changes, made by who, when, and how, makes a big difference and makes project making much easier. Combining this solution with establishing a cadence of accountability would help greatly if we used these concepts and restarted. Having that trust and extra care to be careful with our work and be more attentive helps greatly. Holding eachother accountable builds that support. Talking to eachother regularly and clearly, finalizing decisions before changing anything, and assigning specific responsibilities, are all super helpful as well, and something I will remember for future projects.

Week 05 Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Garrett Cain

I was working on a video game mod with some buddies a few months back. Because of inadequate version control and communication, we had significant problems. Despite not using a common platform, we were all making changes to the same game files, including scripts, textures, and configuration settings. We used Google Drive and Discord to send files, frequently with cryptic names like "xlrltkrr.txt" or "mod2344REAL.zip." We lost hours of progress when someone unintentionally replaced a functional version of the mod with an outdated, broken one. On another occasion, one of the friends made changes to a script that caused it to no longer work with the rest of the mod. Nobody was aware of who or why the alteration was made. As Kogon and Blakemore said, “Projects often stumble because people stumble” (p.118) GitHub would have allowed us to keep track of each one, observe who made it, and revert to stable versions if necessary. Version control on GitHub would have eliminated uncertainty and improved our collaboration. We would have benefited from adhering to the idea of creating frequent accountability as well. We could have made sure that everyone was working on the right files and in agreement by establishing weekly check-ins and clearly defining duties. This arrangement would have avoided misunderstandings and continued the project's progress. I intend to use GitHub and schedule a weekly sync for any upcoming game mods or group digital projects in order to monitor progress and address problems early. Time and frustration can be greatly reduced with this little adjustment.

Week 05 Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Matthew Green

After a few years of working at the refinery I was asked to take on a project to identify all the components in the crude unit that needed repairs or replacement. I created an excel spreadsheet and spent many hours in the unit climbing columns and taking pictures of all the issues that needed attention for the upcoming turnaround maintenance window. I stored the files in the shared O drive dedicated for my unit. Since the entire team had access to the drive it was accidentally deleted.  I should have practiced accountability and stored the file either in a locked drive or in a separate location. I failed to communicate with the team about the project and the location of where I was storing the digital files. It taught me a huge lesson. I had to redo months of work which created an extended timeline to complete the task. I completed the assessment before the maintenance window, but having to quickly redo my work could have caused missed components that needed to be replaced.

Discussion 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Henry Lee
During finals for my music course in 2022 we were all expected to compose a 20 measure instrumental in the strophic form on an app called "Musescore" and play it for the class before turning it in. When I was putting the piece together I ran through multiple drafts, saving each draft to inform the structure of the next, all under the same default name, and all very fast. I ran through 20 drafts, to match the measures, in 2 days, when the project was due in 2 weeks, deciding not to touch it in the longsome meanwhile. So, when I got to the front of the class, clicking what I assumed was the final piece, the perfected 20 measures of strophic form, you can imagine how humiliating it was to hear the dissonant, speaker-garbled mess I ended up playing. After embarrassments, fumbles, pleas for a retry, I was allowed to search for the final piece while the other students played. With 20 drafts piled up, it took me up to a quarterway into the next period to find the piece I needed, and I reluctantly turned it in. If I had set up some cadence of accountability instead of cramming It all in 2 days, I would've been more organized, less stressed, and more attuned to the needs of the piece.

Week 05 Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Toney Winston
Back in high school, I spent nearly a year writing a fantasy book that was about twenty chapters long. I spent hours on worldbuilding, character arcs, and plot twists, and while it was probably not nearly as good as I remember it being, I was proud of it. My laptop was the only place the story existed. One day, my hard drive crashed, and with no backup or alternate copies, everything I had created was gone instantly. The experience was devastating, and it killed my motivation to continue the project at the time. Looking back, a tool like GitHub could have prevented this loss by providing version control and cloud storage for every draft. Cadence of accountability applies here as it always does for writing documents. If I had set a routine of committing my work weekly or even just saving it to both my laptop AND a flash drive or two, I would have built a collection of backups and had a way of tracking progress. That would have protected my project and also allowed me to continue to refine my writing without losing everything in a single failure.

Week 05 Discussion 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help – Michael Buell

A time in my life that a digital project suffered due to lack of communication and poor decision making on my part was back in 2013 when I worked in the media department of New Covenant Church. While working on the website one day I decided to hit the "update" button on the website's content management settings page. I was still pretty new there and had no idea of the disastrous consequences that my decision would have. Since the website was completely custom, updating the content management system without several follow on actions caused the website to become completely broken. Thankfully the web developer had implemented version control and was able to recover the website. This still required a lot of work on his part to accomplish but he was able to get it done. Had I communicated properly before updating the content management system, I could have avoided this mistake entirely.

Kogon and Blakemore (2024) state, "Because lots of problems arise when you're carrying out a project, nobody should feel like they have to solve them alone."(p. 118) Thankfully my leadership at the Church understood this concept and quickly helped me fix the issue I had caused and explained to me why it happened.

Week 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Cynthia Cisneros 

I took a micro credential course this summer and we were placed into groups to work on our major project for the course. Initially, there were four team members in my group. I reached out to them to being collaborating together, but heard no response from them. That prompted me to work on the first deliverable on my own. I turned in my assignment, thinking nothing more of other team members missing in action. Shortly after the deadline for the assignment had passed, the professor assigned another student and myself to one group. I had already turned in my assignment, and so had they. We were then told we needed to collaborate on the second part of the project, and I reached out to my new partner, but no response either. The due date was approaching and I decided to turn in my assignment without the help of my team member. The project in itself was large and required the work of multiple people to be successful. Ultimately, I tried my best to fulfill the criteria and complete the work, but without the intended help, it was challenging. 

Github would have a great resource to use in order to manage the workflow of the project collectively. It would have also provided live documentation of the work completed, as well the reason behind any decisions made. If we had included a team accountability session alongside Github, the outcome could have been different. A team meeting with my professor and my co-partner would have allowed us to discuss what the goals of the project were, what facts we had and how they impacted the work, and what action items we each had to complete the project. These steps would have could have shifted and given me the desired outcome.

Week 5 - Discussion 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help – Sedwin Sanchez

A digital project I remember struggling with was when my siblings and I tried to create a monthly budget using Excel. I was working with my two brothers and one sister, and our parents were mostly watching because they didn’t really know how to use the program. At first, it seemed simple; each of us would make updates and email the file back and forth. The problem came when multiple latest versions started going around. My brothers added their own numbers for entertainment and personal spending, my sister tracked her savings, and I tried to update the bills and groceries. By the end of the week, we had several different versions of the same budget, and none of them matched. At one point, an important payment was left out because it wasn’t included in the version we decided to use. It caused a lot of frustration because we had to go back and redo the work just to make sure the numbers were correct.

Using GitHub could have completely avoided that problem. Instead of sending files back and forth, we could have kept one shared version where all changes were tracked in order. Everyone’s edits would have been seen, so nothing got lost. Pairing this with the Chapter 5 idea of keeping a cadence of accountability would have made a big difference too. If we had short check-ins to review the file together, we would have caught mistakes quickly and stayed on the same page. That would have kept the budget accurate, saved time, and made the process less stressful for all of us.

Week 05 Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Dillon Brown

I can remember countless times where I was working on a project and I lost track of what I changed and what needed to be worked on. When I used to work on digital projects I usually just went on and did the project step by step without monitoring or recording what I have accomplished or changed. This usually ended up somewhere down the line where a mistake was made or a step was skipped or something was changed and I had no idea what, where, or when it happened and I had to spend a considerable amount of time backtracking to find where I made the mistake. In group projects in my school days where we all worked on one single file I could find issues where someone changed something in one part and the rest of us had no idea of it, or a part that needed to be changed went unnoticed. 

With a tool like GitHub, these issues could have been avoided. Being able to monitor and record changes could have allowed me and previous work partners to view the changes made to projects. The power to view the history of a project can also be used as a study source as well, being able to view the history of how a project came to completion can be used as a way to understand a person's thought process of why the made a decision and how the executed it. Using GitHub can allow a person to easily keep track of a project's history and understand the process of a person's decision making and workflow.

Week 05 Discussion 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help – John Barkle

While working through CMPA 3301, I experienced how poor communication in a digital system can undermine accountability. As a brand-new student to Canvas, I had to navigate the platform largely through trial and error because I could not find a clear onboarding tutorial. Because of this, I missed Week 4, Assignment 2 (“Style Your Introduction”). I did not realize that the Module Assignment List extended to a second page. The indicator was there, but I overlooked it, and I assumed I had completed everything due. I only discovered the problem when I clicked through the Grades page, which redirected me to the Assignments view. That page actually lists everything in a single line, and I now use it as my default. The communication system existed, but it was not intuitive, and I believe a Canvas tutorial should be the very first step for new students.

I also had the problem of trying to upload my exercise 2 documentation to the assignment 2 upload portal.  because I was using the same index page from exercise 1 and 2 but modifying it for the new assignment requirements, I had three versions of index.html on my pc at the same time.  only the third index file had the content I need to have for full marks on the assignment.  Therefore after clicking on the wrong file multiple times, I changed the name of my working index file to d-index.html  this let me now that it was the working draft. this wasn't exactly version control in the typical sense but I clearly differentiated between the index file from the previous exercises and this assignment so I would know I was working on the correct version.

To close this gap, I created my own accountability system modeled after GitHub. Each week I open a new ChatGPT thread, which functions as my commit log. When I finish a task, I type an update such as “I have completed the reading for Week 5.” That is my commit. Later, if I ask, “Where am I at right now?” ChatGPT checks the log and tells me the last completed action. At the end of the week, we conduct a “full accountability meeting” by reviewing the entire checklist before submission. This mirrors GitHub’s process where commits document history, branches provide safe sandboxes, and pull requests ensure changes are reviewed and merged back into the main project (GitHub Docs, n.d.). It also reflects Chapter 5’s cadence of accountability, where small, clear promises are tracked consistently and used to build trust (Kogon & Blakemore, 2024).

Week 05 Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Jeff Stein

 At my workplace, responding to federal proposals requires a collaborative effort involving up to 15 different team members. Each proposal requires input from team members who have specialized expertise in clinical operations, accounting, finance, construction, IT, technical writing, and project management all working simultaneously on multiple Word documents. We initially stored these files on a shared file server, which became a nightmare to manage. Team members would copy files locally to their laptops and forgot to upload them back onto the file server and when they did, we did not know which files where the most recent versions. When people did have access, only one person could edit the file on the server at a time causing a bottleneck for others to access. Other times, people would make edits and we did not know what had changed. The absence of version control and real-time collaboration hindered accountability, making it difficult to track individual responsibilities and slowing the team's progress. As a result, the team was unable to achieve optimal performance.  Kogon and Blakemore (2024) state, “When people know they will be held accountable for their promises regularly and often, they are much more likely to perform” (p. 113).

Our organization has recently migrated from a traditional file server system to Microsoft SharePoint, leveraging its co-authoring feature. This transition enables multiple users to edit documents simultaneously, streamlining collaboration and eliminating the creation of duplicate versions. Had our team used GitHub many of these challenges might have been avoided. GitHub’s commit, branch, and pull request features would have enabled team members to make individual edits, record time-stamped changes, and let others know when their work was ready to be combined within the final documentation. These features help maintain the cadence of accountability of the team’s progress and ownership of work performed.

Week 5 - Discussion 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Jason Lohoefer

During a building wide IT project I was involved in recently, my team and I were tasked with creating a spreadsheet to document every component in the system such as servers, switches, IP cameras, and other critical devices. At first it seemed manageable, but as multiple team members updated the spreadsheet separately as we explored different floors and further segments of the network we inherited, serious version control problems emerged. Different copies were emailed around, and before long we had files named “system-doc-final”, “system-doc-final-v3” and “system-doc-final-v3-jwl updated” and no real way to decipher which was the most recent. Important updates like the discovery and addition of new IP camera locations were sometimes lost or duplicated because no one knew which file represented the most accurate and up to date version. This confusion slowed progress and created unnecessary work.

A tool like GitHub certainly could have solved this quickly by serving as a centralized repository with a clear version history. Every change would have been logged, timestamped, and tied to the person who made it, removing any guesswork. Combined with the Chapter 5 principle of “a cadence of accountability” (Kogon & Blakemore, 2024), regular check-ins using the shared repository would have kept the team aligned and ensured the spreadsheet stayed reliable and up to date for the entire building. In practice, we resolved the issue by using a shared Microsoft Excel file online, but the same accountability principle applies.

Week 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help

I have done this countless times, creating a new file instead of updating the existing one. I have gotten better about this because of the amount of stress it has caused me. I have done it with resumes, personal spreadsheets, among others. The worst part happens after I have created a new file. A week or so later, when I need the "new" file, I forget which one is the correct one. I have given them titles that all say "New", still doesn't help. The past few years I have overcome this hurdle and am now way more organized and I hold myself accountable. A tool like GitHub is going to make this more efficient and less stressful. Having Github along with my own personal improvements, I don't see any future problems arising.

Week 05 Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Kierstin Russell

A time that a digital project of mine suffered due to loss of control took place in my senior year of high school. Having left band, I filled the elective hour with an architecture class, a subject I long had interest in. One of our final projects consisted of creating and drafting a house's blueprint by hand, sketching a model of the house, creating a digital version of the blueprint in AutoCAD, and plugging the design model into the SketchUp platform. This project excited my brain, with the design aspect triggering my creative mind, and the mathematical blueprinting requiring logic. I still have my Strathmore Sketch pad with the physical sketches of all of our assignments. Now where did this project take a turn for the worse? One day I walked into the classroom, found my seat at the computer against the wall on the far side of the classroom in the second row, and powered it on. Only it didn't power on to its normal state. Rather, I saw my first blue screen of death. "How did this happen? What does that mean for my work? The project is due this week and I can't access my files..." These were all thoughts running through my head at the time, and I ultimately never recovered my work. On a positive note for my grade, the teacher had already seen my progress and I continued with what I could, but in the grand scheme of project management, I failed. Why didn't I have a flash drive on standby every day? Were there options for cloud storage? In hindsight, I could have been much more prepared and mitigated the risk of total loss had I planned out my project and predicted the worst. Perhaps an IT technician at the school could have recovered my work somehow. A tool like GitHub, combined with Kogon and Blakemore's (2024) goal to "inspire shared accountability", could have helped prevent the problem by providing me with both local and remote repositories of my work and its versions, as well as the accountability to create backup storage plans in case any of my options failed.

Discussion 5: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Rylie Ivins 

One time, I had an issue while working on a digital art piece for a client. I wasn't aware of specific colors that she wanted, and I only found out after I sent her what I wanted to be the final draft. She didn't like it, and I had to spend a lot of extra time redoing a section of the world. The problem came down to poor communication. There wasn't clear communication on when I should have asked about specifications such as color preferences. If I had used a tool like GitHub, I could have uploaded different versions of the art as I went along, keeping a clear history of my progress and giving the client a chance to review earlier stages. That would have saved me from doing a full rework later on. Combined with he principle of setting a cadence of accountability from Chapter 5, I could have scheduled regular check-ins to confirm details like the color choices before moving forward. This combination of version control and accountability would have made this project much smoother and more efficient for both of us.

Week 05, Discussion 05: Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help- Ramona Gloria

     I remember the challenges I faced last year while applying for a job position. I was confident that I had my resume saved on my computer, but over the years, my approach to managing it became chaotic. Instead of simply replacing the existing file with an updated version, I decided to create new files with different names each time I revised it. This decision, though seemingly harmless at the time, resulted in a confusing multitude of documents, each representing different stages of my resume. As the number of versions accumulated, I found myself in a frustrating predicament. I had to sift through multiple files, each labeled with variations of my name or dates, just to determine which one contained the most recent updates. As Kogon and Blakemore (2024) discussed, accountability surfaces the problem so that the problem can be dealt with quickly.  This experience highlighted a breakdown in my personal organization and communication; I had branches of my resume scattered across my computer, but no clear commitment to a single, definitive version. The entire process was not only time-consuming but also counterproductive, as I struggled to recall which file had the latest improvements. If only I had prioritized managing my resume more effectively and held myself accountable to a better system, I could have saved myself countless hours of searching and stress. 

      Reflecting on this, I couldn’t help but draw parallels to GitHub. With GitHub, each change I make to a document can be neatly organized through commits that log the modifications, timestamps, and the responsible party for each update. This system would have transformed my resume management from a chaotic ordeal into a streamlined process, enabling me to focus more on applying for jobs rather than wasting time on file confusion. Implementing such an organized approach for my resumes could have significantly enhanced my productivity and reduced my frustration during the job search.

                                                                                                                                                                         Reference

Week 05 Reflecting on Digital Projects and Ways to Help - Cameron Combs

One digital project that suffered because of version control was a Python file. The code contained examples of the language’s basic mechanics, which made it a great reference resource. However, there was a period when I was unable to locate it. 

I began to look through my files in File Explorer. However, the file was not stored there. After searching in other places, I was able to locate it in my Google Drive folder. After locating the file, I began to understand why I had difficulties finding the code. In the past, I had managed the file on Google Colab, which automatically saves the file to my Google Drive folder. This explained why I was unable to find the file in my File Explorer. 

A principle discussed in in Kogon and Blakemore (2024) that I learned from this experience is the need to practice accountability. If I had made it a priority to effectively manage my python file, I would not have lost it. Also, if I had used GitHub to manage my file, I would have been able to easily access the file’s location. Ultimately, using the principle of practicing accountability and using GitHub would have prevented this issue from occurring.

## Project 02 - Your Professional Project Repository
 ### Prompt
 
In this project, you will elevate your local website into a professional, version-controlled project. You will create a GitHub repository, publish your personal website to a live public URL, and document your process with a professional README.md file.

 ### Detailed Explanation
 
This project represents a significant step in your development as a hybrid technical worker working with online computing technologies and platforms.

You will move beyond creating local files and learn the fundamental workflow of modern collaborative projects.

By creating a GitHub repository, you are creating a central, permanent home for your project.
By using the Git version control system (via GitHub Desktop), you will learn to document your work through "commits."
By publishing your site to the web, you will experience the full cycle of development from idea to live product. The repository you create will be the foundation for all your future work and will also function as a public portfolio piece.
 
Your Project 02 submission will contain two URLs: 1) a link to your live https://<your-username>.github.io website and 2) a link to your new GitHub repository.

Remember: Projects are not tutorials with every answer provided for you. You must act as a professional, hybrid technical worker and unofficial project manager, carefully review the prompt, the Minimum Expectations and Guidelines, and the listed resources. 

### Minimum Expectations and Guidelines
 Project 02 requires, at a minimum, the following:

- A new public repository on GitHub.com
- Your new repository cloned to your computer
- Files in your repository: README.md, index.html, style.css
- Your live website on <your-username>.github.io
 
 
 ### - Create a new public repository on GitHub.com
 You must create a new public repository on GitHub.comLinks to an external site. named exactly <your-username>.github.io (replacing <your-username> with your own GitHub username). Note: Your repository must be public, not private.

Remember: Replace <your-username> with your own GitHub username. 

When you create a new public repository on GitHub.comLinks to an external site. and enter <your-username>.github.io into the Repository name field, you will see something similar to the following screenshot:

Screenshot via https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-siteLinks to an external site..


As that screenshot demonstrates, if your username were octocat, you would have entered octocat.github.io for the Repository name field.

### - Enable the built-in web hosting feature of your repository (GitHub Pages)
 You must publish your website online using GitHub Pages. This process is straightforward:
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to your new repository's main page, and click the [Settings] tab 1

2. In the left sidebar, click the [Pages] item
3. Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select Deploy from a branch.
4. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", change the branch from None to main (don't change other settings)

5. Select [Save]. The new live website URL will be displayed at the top of the page.
It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

### - Clone your new repository and add your files
 
The new repository you created must contain your styled website from Assignment 02 (index.html and style.css). To move these files into your new repository on your computer, you must clone your repository from GitHub to a folder on your computer.

Use GitHub Desktop to clone your new repository to your computer by clicking the Open with GitHub Desktop option on your repository's main page from within your web browser. You will see something similar to the following screenshot:

A screenshot of GitHub showing the Open with GitHub Desktop repository option

Screenshot via https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktopLinks to an external site. 

**Note:** After using GitHub Desktop to clone your new repository, it will appear as a normal folder on your computer. You will use VS Code to open this folder and make changes to files, and your operating system's file system to perform basic computer tasks, such as viewing the folder, dragging and dropping files, etc.

Follow GitHub Desktop's official help article: Cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub DesktopLinks to an external site..

• — A README.md in your repository
You can create a starter README when you create your new repository (via the Add README option). If you skipped the Add README, you will use VS Code to create a README.md file in your cloned repository folder on your computer.

The repository must contain a README.md file written in Markdown that includes at least the following information: 

A clear title for the project.
A paragraph describing the purpose of the website.
A link to the live website.
 
**Note:* You can locate the live website URL after configuring your new repository to publish your website.

 • — Write commit messages and push your changes as you work
 
As you work on Project 02 on your computer, you need to write commits and push your changes to your repository on GitHub.

Your new repository must have a commit history of at least three distinct commits. The commit messages should be clear and descriptive.

You will use GitHub Desktop to select changed files to include in commits, write commit messages, and then push your changes. 

Follow GitHub Desktop's official help for committing and reviewing changes to your project in GitHub DesktopLinks to an external site.:

Selecting changes to include in a commitLinks to an external site.
Write a commit message and push your changesLinks to an external site.
Viewing the branch history in GitHub DesktopLinks to an external site.
 
### • — Your website must be published online using GitHub Pages
Your website will be published online using the built-in web hosting feature of your GitHub repository. The website must be live and accessible at https://<your-username>.github.io. Replace <your-username> with your own GitHub username.

Each time you push your changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop on your computer, your GitHub repository will publish those changes to your website.

It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

### • — Verify
- Verify: Did you create your new repository named <your-username>.github.io?
- Verify: Did you enable your new repository to publish your website on GitHub Pages?
- Verify: Did you clone your new repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop?
- Verify: Do you know the location of your cloned repository folder on your computer?
- Verify: Did you open your new cloned repository folder with VS CodeLinks to an external site.?
- Verify: Did you add your index.html and style.css files to your cloned repository folder on your computer?
- Verify: Does your cloned repository folder have a README.md file?
- Verify: Did you verify that your index.html, style.css, and README.md files have updated, real content? No placeholder content. No low-effort content.
- Verify: Did you make multiple commits and push your changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop?
- Verify: Did you meet the minimum requirements?
- erify: Did you double-check your work? Triple-check?
- rify: Did you open your live website in your web browser? After pushing your changes using GitHub Desktop?

### ect Submission Requirements

Week 05: Wrap-up
Week 05: Wrap-Up
 

This week was a major milestone! You successfully published your first website to the live internet and created a professional project repository on GitHub. You learned the fundamental workflow of version control, a cornerstone of modern collaborative work. You have now experienced the full project cycle from local idea to public product.

 

 

Looking Ahead to Week 06
 

Next week, we will focus on what happens during a project. We will read about how to "Track & Adapt" in PMUPM and explore the difference between unproductive "scope creep" and valuable "scope discovery." We will also return to Range to discuss how to solve problems in complex, "wicked" environments.
