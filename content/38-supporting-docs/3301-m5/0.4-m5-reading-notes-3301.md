## Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) – Reading Review

- **SLO-5: Engage the Team**  
  - *Insight:* Version control isn’t just technical—it’s about accountability. Each commit is a visible promise kept.  
  - *Applied Example:* Commit messages like “Added CSS for readability” show intent and progress, building trust in teamwork:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

- **SLO-4: Version Control Basics**  
  - *Insight:* GitHub Desktop makes version control accessible without command-line use.  
  - *Applied Example:* Creating a branch for an experiment = creating a safe sandbox (PMUPM principle: minimize risk while innovating):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

- **SLO-4: Publishing & Structure**  
  - *Insight:* GitHub Pages turns a repository into a live professional artifact.  
  - *Applied Example:* README + index.html + style.css = structure that communicates purpose and professionalism:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## PMUPM Chapter 5 – Engaging the Team
- **Core Principle:** Accountability creates trust.  
- *Quote:* “When you keep your commitments, you become a trustworthy human being. You gain the trust of your team members, who will be encouraged to keep their commitments as well” (Kogon, Ch. 5):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  

**Applied Example:**  
- Commits = cadence of accountability.  
- Branches = safe sandbox.  
- Pull requests = team accountability sessions (even simulated when solo).

## GitHub Guide – Commits, Branches, Pull Requests
- **Commits (Project Diary):** Snapshots + reasons, not just saves.  
- **Branches (Safe Sandbox):** Parallel paths to experiment without risk.  
- **Pull Requests (Formal Review):** Structured accountability and feedback:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  

Applied: These features directly map to PMUPM Chapter 5 principles — accountability, trust, and communication.

## Applied Takeaways for Project 02
- Use **commits** as accountability logs.  
- Use **branches** for experimentation.  
- Use **pull requests** as reflection/review points.  
- Align every action with **PMUPM Ch. 5 principles**: commitments kept, trust built, accountability maintained.  
- Treat the repository as both a **project deliverable** and a **portfolio artifact** demonstrating professionalism.
