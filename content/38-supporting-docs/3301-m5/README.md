# Module 5 â€“ Supporting Documents

This folder contains all supporting documentation for **CMPA 3301 â€“ Week 05 (Project M5)**.  
It combines course-supplied "0-series" inputs with PMI-aligned project management artifacts (Docs 1â€“6).  
The structure simulates a professional PMI project binder while remaining adapted for a one-week academic project.
