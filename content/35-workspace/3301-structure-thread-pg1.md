3301 m5 week 5 classwork
ChatGPT said:

For CMPA 3301 – Module 5, Week 5 classwork, the focus is on moving beyond categories and into classification systems. Here’s the distilled takeaway from the assigned reading and context:

Categorization vs. Classification:
Categorization can be informal or ad hoc. Classification is systematic and intentional — a deliberate framework designed to be applied consistently.

Classification Systems:
A classification system is more than just a list of categories; it includes explicit rules about structure and assignment. It captures distinctions and relationships in a domain, serving as a conceptual roadmap for users.

Hierarchical Classification:
Think “is-a” relationships (e.g., a poodle is-a dog, a dog is-a mammal). Your folder structures from earlier weeks are simple examples of hierarchical systems.

Faceted Classification:
More flexible than hierarchies. Resources are described with multiple properties (“facets”) like style, color, size. This allows cross-cutting organization and filtering.

Relationships Between Resources:
Beyond grouping, classification involves making relationships explicit — hierarchical (containment), semantic (authorship, meaning), or structural (sequence, position). In digital systems, these relationships often define how users interact with content.

That’s the core of Week 5: formalizing categories into systems, learning the difference between rigid hierarchies and flexible facets, and understanding how relationships bind resources together.

Do you want me to pull your exact assignment instructions for Week 5 (like exercises or deliverables), or just stick with the reading takeaways?

here is the week overview it contains an ordered to do list  create a customer request form file name cr-wk5p2-your-professional-project-repository.  considedr the over the answer to your interview questions.  do tyou have any other quetions forme
ChatGPT said:

Yes. I need to lock scope before drafting your cr-wk5p2-your-professional-project-repository.md.

To make sure the Customer Request (CR) file is correct, I need a couple of things from you first:

Customer Identity – Who is the “customer” here? (You, your instructor, a hypothetical company?)

Interview Answers – You mentioned “consider the answers to your interview questions.” Do you already have those written, or should I draft interview questions and then capture answers in the CR?

Purpose – Is this CR specifically about setting up your professional project repository (e.g., GitHub/Obsidian repo), or about how it will be organized/classified per Week 5’s classification lesson?

Once I know those three, I can create the CR file in Markdown that fits the assignment exactly.

You said:
instructor is customer I am sponsor-  no I mean read teh overview.  any questios you woul d ask me in initial interview will most like ly be answered in the overview.  If you have aditional questions to set scope and success let me know  this cr is about completing project 2 in total  all delivrables
ChatGPT said:

Got it. So for cr-wk5p2-your-professional-project-repository.md the situation is:

Customer = Instructor

Sponsor = You

Scope = Project 2 in total (all deliverables)

Source = Week 5 overview (which already contains answers to most “interview” questions)

Before I draft, here are the only clarifications I’d need to avoid scope creep or missing pieces:

Does the overview explicitly list all deliverables for Project 2, or should I infer them from earlier modules (M1–M4) as well?

Should the CR be formatted as a formal customer request form (sections like Background, Objectives, Deliverables, Constraints, Success Criteria), or just a plain markdown outline?

Do you want me to mirror the style and headings used in your Week 4 CR file (cr-wk4…) for consistency?

Once you confirm those, I can produce the CR file in markdown, version-labeled, and ready to go.

Project 02 - Your Professional Project Repository
 

star.pngPrompt
 

In this project, you will elevate your local website into a professional, version-controlled project. You will create a GitHub repository, publish your personal website to a live public URL, and document your process with a professional README.md file.

 

 

info.pngDetailed Explanation
 

This project represents a significant step in your development as a hybrid technical worker working with online computing technologies and platforms.

You will move beyond creating local files and learn the fundamental workflow of modern collaborative projects.

 

By creating a GitHub repository, you are creating a central, permanent home for your project.
By using the Git version control system (via GitHub Desktop), you will learn to document your work through "commits."
By publishing your site to the web, you will experience the full cycle of development from idea to live product. The repository you create will be the foundation for all your future work and will also function as a public portfolio piece.
 

Your Project 02 submission will contain two URLs: 1) a link to your live https://<your-username>.github.io website and 2) a link to your new GitHub repository.

 

Remember: Projects are not tutorials with every answer provided for you. You must act as a professional, hybrid technical worker and unofficial project manager, carefully review the prompt, the Minimum Expectations and Guidelines, and the listed resources. 

 

 

bullseye.pngMinimum Expectations and Guidelines
 

Project 02 requires, at a minimum, the following:

 

A new public repository on GitHub.com
Your new repository cloned to your computer
Files in your repository: README.md, index.html, style.css
Your live website on <your-username>.github.io
 

• — Create a new public repository on GitHub.com
 

You must create a new public repository on GitHub.comLinks to an external site. named exactly <your-username>.github.io (replacing <your-username> with your own GitHub username). Note: Your repository must be public, not private.

Remember: Replace <your-username> with your own GitHub username. 


When you create a new public repository on GitHub.comLinks to an external site. and enter <your-username>.github.io into the Repository name field, you will see something similar to the following screenshot:

Screenshot of GitHub highlighting the repository name field outlined in dark orange.
Screenshot via https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-siteLinks to an external site..


As that screenshot demonstrates, if your username were octocat, you would have entered octocat.github.io for the Repository name field.

 

 

• — Enable the built-in web hosting feature of your repository (GitHub Pages)
 

You must publish your website online using GitHub Pages. This process is straightforward:

 

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to your new repository's main page, and click the [Settings] tab 

A screenshot of GitHub highlighting the Settings tab with a dark orange outline

 

2. In the left sidebar, click the [Pages] item

 

3. Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select Deploy from a branch.

 

4. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", change the branch from None to main (don't change other settings)

A screenshot showing the GitHub Pages "Build and deployment" settings

 

5. Select [Save]. The new live website URL will be displayed at the top of the page.

 

It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

 

 

• — Clone your new repository and add your files
 

The new repository you created must contain your styled website from Assignment 02 (index.html and style.css). To move these files into your new repository on your computer, you must clone your repository from GitHub to a folder on your computer.


Use GitHub Desktop to clone your new repository to your computer by clicking the Open with GitHub Desktop option on your repository's main page from within your web browser. You will see something similar to the following screenshot:

 

A screenshot of GitHub showing the Open with GitHub Desktop repository option

Screenshot via https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktopLinks to an external site. 

 

Note: After using GitHub Desktop to clone your new repository, it will appear as a normal folder on your computer. You will use VS Code to open this folder and make changes to files, and your operating system's file system to perform basic computer tasks, such as viewing the folder, dragging and dropping files, etc.

 

Follow GitHub Desktop's official help article: Cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub DesktopLinks to an external site..

 

 

• — A README.md in your repository
 

You can create a starter README when you create your new repository (via the Add README option). If you skipped the Add README, you will use VS Code to create a README.md file in your cloned repository folder on your computer.

 

The repository must contain a README.md file written in Markdown that includes at least the following information: 

A clear title for the project.
A paragraph describing the purpose of the website.
A link to the live website.
 

Note: You can locate the live website URL after configuring your new repository to publish your website.

 

 

• — Write commit messages and push your changes as you work
 

As you work on Project 02 on your computer, you need to write commits and push your changes to your repository on GitHub.

 

Your new repository must have a commit history of at least three distinct commits. The commit messages should be clear and descriptive.

 

You will use GitHub Desktop to select changed files to include in commits, write commit messages, and then push your changes. 

 

Follow GitHub Desktop's official help for committing and reviewing changes to your project in GitHub DesktopLinks to an external site.:

Selecting changes to include in a commitLinks to an external site.
Write a commit message and push your changesLinks to an external site.
Viewing the branch history in GitHub DesktopLinks to an external site.
 

 

• — Your website must be published online using GitHub Pages
 

Your website will be published online using the built-in web hosting feature of your GitHub repository. The website must be live and accessible at https://<your-username>.github.io. Replace <your-username> with your own GitHub username.

Each time you push your changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop on your computer, your GitHub repository will publish those changes to your website.

 

It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

 

 

• — Verify
 

Verify: Did you create your new repository named <your-username>.github.io?

Verify: Did you enable your new repository to publish your website on GitHub Pages?

Verify: Did you clone your new repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop?

Verify: Do you know the location of your cloned repository folder on your computer?

Verify: Did you open your new cloned repository folder with VS CodeLinks to an external site.?

Verify: Did you add your index.html and style.css files to your cloned repository folder on your computer?

Verify: Does your cloned repository folder have a README.md file?

Verify: Did you verify that your index.html, style.css, and README.md files have updated, real content? No placeholder content. No low-effort content.

Verify: Did you make multiple commits and push your changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop?

Verify: Did you meet the minimum requirements?

Verify: Did you double-check your work? Triple-check?

Verify: Did you open your live website in your web browser? After pushing your changes using GitHub Desktop?

Perfect — that gives me the Project 02 full scope. Thanks for dropping the actual project page, that’s the anchor.

Before I draft the Customer Request (CR) file, here are the last two things I need to confirm:

Format – Do you want this CR structured like a formal request-for-service form (with headings like Background, Objectives, Deliverables, Success Criteria, Constraints, Resources) or a simpler outline (bulleted/numbered list of requirements from the overview)?

Voice – Since the instructor is the customer and you’re the sponsor, should the CR be written from you to the instructor (formal proposal style), or as a neutral project document that summarizes the customer’s request and sponsor’s role?

Once I have that, I can output cr-wk5p2-your-professional-project-repository.md in clean markdown, scoped to Project 02 and audit-ready.

You said:
follow standard pmi certification requiremnets as if the test question were  create a pmi comliant cr
ChatGPT said:

Understood — we’ll treat this exactly as if the PMP exam question was: “Create a PMI-compliant Customer Request (CR) for Project 02.”

That means the CR must:

Capture Business Need (why the customer wants this).

Define Objectives (what must be achieved).

State Deliverables (outputs requested).

Include Acceptance Criteria / Success Measures.

Note Constraints and Assumptions.

Identify Customer and Sponsor roles.

I’ll build it in Markdown, filename:
cr-wk5p2-your-professional-project-repository.md

Here’s the draft v1:

# Customer Request (CR) – Project 02: Your Professional Project Repository
**Document ID:** cr-wk5p2-your-professional-project-repository  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Customer:** Course Instructor  
**Sponsor:** [Student Name]  

---

## 1. Business Need
The instructor (customer) requires the creation of a professional project repository to demonstrate student mastery of version control, web publishing, and documentation practices. This repository will elevate a locally developed website into a public, professional portfolio artifact that reflects industry standards for hybrid technical workers.

---

## 2. Project Objectives
- Establish a public GitHub repository named `<your-username>.github.io`.  
- Publish the personal website to a live URL via GitHub Pages.  
- Document the repository with a professional `README.md` file.  
- Demonstrate correct use of Git version control through multiple commits and descriptive commit messages.  
- Ensure the live site is functional, styled, and accessible to the public.

---

## 3. Deliverables
- A new public GitHub repository correctly named `<your-username>.github.io`.  
- Repository cloned locally with all required files:  
  - `index.html` (styled website content)  
  - `style.css` (site styling)  
  - `README.md` (professional documentation)  
- At least three documented and pushed commits with clear commit messages.  
- A live published website accessible at `https://<your-username>.github.io`.  
- Submission of:  
  1. URL to the live website  
  2. URL to the GitHub repository  

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Repository is public, correctly named, and free of placeholder or low-effort content.  
- `README.md` includes project title, purpose, and live website link.  
- Minimum of three commits with professional commit messages.  
- Live website functions without errors; all styles and links render properly.  
- Both URLs submitted to course platform before deadline (Sep 14, 2025, 11:59 PM).  

---

## 5. Constraints
- Repository must be public (not private).  
- Only approved tools may be used: GitHub Desktop, VS Code, GitHub Pages.  
- Deadline is fixed; late submissions may not be accepted.  
- Minimum expectations must be met for passing credit; rubric will be applied for grading.  

---

## 6. Assumptions
- Student has access to GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and VS Code.  
- Student’s prior assignment files (`index.html`, `style.css`) are available and functional.  
- Internet connectivity is sufficient to clone, commit, push, and publish.  
- Customer (instructor) will evaluate based on rubric provided in project brief.  

---

## 7. Roles
- **Customer (Instructor):** Defines requirements, evaluates deliverables, and accepts or rejects based on rubric.  
- **Sponsor (Student):** Provides resources, ensures execution of tasks, and is accountable for meeting all deliverables on time.  

---

## 8. Success Criteria
Project 02 will be considered successful if:  
- Both URLs are submitted on time.  
- The repository and live website meet rubric standards at the *Exemplary* or *Proficient* level.  
- The project functions as a professional portfolio artifact demonstrating competence with GitHub, version control, and publishing workflow.  


This structure follows PMI standards for a customer request while mapping directly to your assignment.

Do you want me to also add a traceability link at the end (tying each deliverable to a rubric criterion), or keep this lean?

You said:
what is the this weeks deliverables?
ChatGPT said:

This week’s deliverables are the outputs for Project 02: Your Professional Project Repository. Based on the project page and overview, you are required to produce and submit:

A public GitHub repository

Correctly named: <your-username>.github.io

Repository must be public, not private.

Repository contents

index.html (from Assignment 02, styled content)

style.css (from Assignment 02, site styling)

README.md (professional documentation, with project title, purpose, and link to live site)

Version control history

At least three distinct commits with clear, descriptive commit messages.

Live website

Published via GitHub Pages

Accessible at: https://<your-username>.github.io

Must render properly with styling and links working.

Submission package

URL to the live website

URL to the GitHub repository

These map directly to the rubric: repository setup, version control workflow, and live website functionality.

Do you want me to turn this into a checklist-style deliverables section that we can drop straight into your CR document so it aligns cleanly with PMI-style scope definition?

You said:
is tihis what he wants?
ChatGPT said:

Yes — you’re very close, but a couple of details still need correction to fully meet the Project 02 requirements:

✅ Repository name: Correct. You have it as JASYTIONLINE-jasytionline.github.io and it is public. That satisfies the naming and visibility requirement.

⚠️ Index file: The repo currently has index.md, but the project explicitly requires index.html (with your styled website content). Markdown will not render as the homepage for GitHub Pages. You’ll need to rename or replace it with index.html.

⚠️ CSS file: I don’t see style.css in the repo yet. This file is also required.

⚠️ Commit history: You currently show only 2 commits. The requirement is a minimum of 3 distinct commits with descriptive commit messages.

✅ README.md: Present, but should include a clear project title, a short paragraph describing the purpose of your website, and a link to the live site. Right now it’s very minimal (“cmpa 3301 project repo”).

Once you fix those (swap index.md → index.html, add style.css, push another commit or two with clear messages, and expand the README with the live URL), you’ll meet all deliverables and grading rubric requirements.

Do you want me to give you the exact commit plan (what to change and push for the next 1–2 commits) so you can close all the gaps in one clean sweep?

You said:
it is in script  is that ok?
ChatGPT said:

No — it’s not okay if your website only has a script file.

The Project 02 requirements are very explicit:

Your repository must contain index.html and style.css.

GitHub Pages will only serve an index.html (or sometimes index.htm) as the homepage. If you only have index.md or a script file, the live site won’t render correctly.

The script can stay in your project if you’re experimenting, but the grading and rubric require:

index.html with actual website content (from Assignment 02).

style.css to show that you know how to apply styles.

README.md with title, purpose, and link to live site.

If your styled site content is currently inside a script, you need to move it into index.html and reference your style.css.

Do you want me to walk you step by step on how to convert what you have now into the required index.html + style.css structure so it passes the rubric?

You said:
no I have the .css in the script folder and refernce on the html
ChatGPT said:

Got it — thanks for clarifying. That’s fine.

As long as:

Your index.html is at the root of the repository (not inside /script),

And inside that HTML you reference your CSS with a relative path like:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="script/style.css">


Then GitHub Pages will load it correctly.

Right now in your repo screenshot, I don’t see an index.html at the root — only index.md. That’s the part that will block you. GitHub Pages will try to serve index.html and won’t find it.

So you need to:

Rename or replace index.md with your actual index.html.

Keep your script/style.css folder structure if you prefer — that’s acceptable.

Would you like me to give you the exact git steps (commit messages included) to swap in your index.html and push it, so you end up with 3+ commits and meet the rubric in one pass?

You said:
so each folder gets a index.md for obsidian navigation -  each folder is uploaded to gh, but only the fodlers I want on gh.io get an thml?
ChatGPT said:

Exactly — you’ve got the distinction right:

For Obsidian (local knowledge base):
Each folder can have its own index.md. That gives you clean navigation inside Obsidian. Markdown files are for you (notes, navigation, repo structure).

For GitHub Pages (public website):
GitHub Pages doesn’t render .md as the homepage. It only looks for an index.html (or index.htm) in the repo root or in subfolders.

If a folder has an index.html, then visiting yoursite.github.io/foldername/ will display that HTML page.

If it only has index.md, GitHub will just show the raw Markdown file in the repo view, not as part of the website.

So the rule of thumb is:

Markdown (index.md) → for internal organization, notes, documentation, Obsidian navigation.

HTML (index.html) → for anything you want to publish to the live GitHub Pages site.

That way, you can safely keep Markdown indexes in all your project folders without breaking anything, but only the folders you “convert” with an index.html will appear polished and styled on the public site.

Do you want me to sketch a folder/repo layout example showing how both can coexist cleanly (so Obsidian works for you, and GitHub Pages works for the instructor)?

You said:
add that to the main readme
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a clean addition you can drop straight into your main README.md to explain the dual purpose of your repo (Obsidian navigation vs. GitHub Pages publishing):

## Repository Structure and Publishing Notes

This repository is designed to support two workflows:

1. **Local Knowledge Base (Obsidian)**  
   - Each folder contains an `index.md` file.  
   - These Markdown files provide internal navigation inside Obsidian and serve as documentation for project organization.  
   - They are not intended to be rendered as web pages.

2. **Public Website (GitHub Pages)**  
   - GitHub Pages requires an `index.html` at the root of the repository (and in any subfolders meant to be public).  
   - Only folders containing `index.html` files will display styled content on the live site.  
   - CSS and other assets (e.g., `/script/style.css`) are linked within the HTML to provide styling.

**Rule of Thumb:**  
- Use `index.md` for documentation and navigation.  
- Use `index.html` for public-facing web content on `https://<username>.github.io`.  

This dual structure allows the repository to function both as a professional portfolio site and as a private knowledge base for project development.


Would you like me to also draft a commit message you can use when you add this to the README, so it counts toward your 3+ commits for the rubric?

You said:
showme thetable in the readme once more
ChatGPT said:

Here’s the same information rewritten as a table for your README.md. This format makes it clearer at a glance:

## Repository Structure and Publishing Notes

| Purpose                        | File Type   | Location            | Effect                                                       |
|--------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local Knowledge Base (Obsidian) | `index.md`  | Each folder         | Provides navigation and documentation inside Obsidian. Not rendered on GitHub Pages. |
| Public Website (GitHub Pages)   | `index.html`| Repo root + public folders | Displays styled content at `https://<username>.github.io`. Required for publishing. |
| Styling / Assets                | `.css`, etc.| `/script` or other asset folders | Linked by `index.html` to style and support public-facing pages. |

**Rule of Thumb:**  
- Use `index.md` for internal documentation and navigation.  
- Use `index.html` for anything you want published to the live website.


This will make your README both rubric-friendly (clear, professional doc) and future-proof for your workflow.

Do you want me to also include a “Live Site and Repo Links” section right under this table, so the instructor sees them immediately when they open your README?

Tip: after renaming folders, update any internal links in your README.md or Obsidian notes to the new paths so navigation doesn’t break.

Perfect—here are the two files you asked for.

1) index.html (root) — single, public-facing link to Deliverables
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport"
        content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Professional Project Repository</title>
</head>
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>Professional Project Repository</h1>
    <p>
      This site publishes only the final, public deliverables for the
      course projects. To view the graded submission package, open:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="33-deliverables/"
         title="Open the folder that contains the public project deliverables">
        Open Project Deliverables (Public Portfolio)
      </a>
    </p>
  </main>
</body>
</html>

2) index.md (root or README.md) — navigation to each folder’s index.md
# Repository Navigation (KB)

Use these links to open the Markdown `index.md` inside each folder.
These are for knowledge-base navigation in Obsidian and on GitHub.

- **Deliverables**  
  `33-deliverables/index.md`

- **Workspace (drafts and builds)**  
  `35-workspace/index.md`

- **Knowledge (course references)**  
  `37-knowledge/index.md`

- **Supporting Docs (audit trail)**  
  `38-supporting-docs/index.md`

- **MWR (personal learning)**  
  `39-mwr/index.md`


Notes

Keep index.html at the repo root so GitHub Pages loads it as the
homepage.

Each listed folder should contain its own index.md file (you already
have your folders named 33-…, 35-…, 37-…, 38-…, 39-…).

If you later want a public web page for a subfolder, add an
index.html inside that folder; otherwise the .md stays as internal
navigation only.

If you want, I can also give you short commit messages to knock out the
“3+ commits” rubric cleanly.

You said:
it needs comments explainign its purpose  doesnt it  I cant use yaml here right
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 28s

Yes—use comments. Don’t use YAML in this context.

HTML pages: add <!-- HTML comments -->. They won’t show on the page, but anyone viewing source (or you in VS Code) will see them.

Markdown files: you can also use HTML comments (<!-- ... -->) inside .md and they won’t render. That’s the simplest, portable way. (YAML front-matter is for Jekyll/Obsidian, but you said you don’t want it here.)

Here are the two files again with clear comments added:

index.html (root)
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Professional Project Repository</title>
  <!--
    PURPOSE:
      - This is the public homepage for GitHub Pages.
      - Keep it minimal by design: it only points to the public deliverables.
      - All drafting, KB, and audit materials stay in Markdown inside subfolders.
    PUBLISHING:
      - Must live at repo root as index.html so GH Pages serves it.
    NAV MODEL:
      - Add more links here ONLY if you intend to publish more folders as HTML.

        Open Project Deliverables (Public Portfolio)
      </a>
    </p>
  </main>
</body>
</html>

index.md (root) — KB navigation (with comments)
<!--
  PURPOSE:
    - Internal KB navigation only.
    - Links directly to each folder's index.md for Obsidian/GitHub browsing.
  NOTE:
    - This file is NOT the public homepage. GitHub Pages serves index.html.
-->

# Repository Navigation (KB)

Use these links to open the Markdown `index.md` inside each folder.

- **Deliverables**  
  `33-deliverables/index.md`

- **Workspace (drafts and builds)**  
  `35-workspace/index.md`

- **Knowledge (course references)**  
  `37-knowledge/index.md`

- **Supporting Docs (audit trail)**  
  `38-supporting-docs/index.md`

- **MWR (personal learning)**  
  `39-mwr/index.md`


If you later decide a subfolder should be public, add an index.html inside that folder (and keep its index.md for your KB).

You said:
use the same YAML style  so it shows all the YAML info  just commetn it out
ChatGPT said:

Perfect. Here are both files using your standard YAML header, but
commented out so it’s visible for audit and won’t be processed by
GH Pages. I’ve wrapped long lines to avoid sideways scrolling.

If you want quick rubric-friendly commits:

feat: add commented YAML + minimal public homepage

docs: add KB nav index.md with commented YAML

chore: update README with G ⇄ ME crosswalk

You said:
we should just make one master .md file. Then comment our everything I don't want rendered on the live site.  Then I can navigate to the .md in obsidian, make edits, remove comments of the sections I wont to be acted upon in the browser, save as .html .  That way I don't have to change two documents  just the .md.  So you just make one master file. the .md. I will manipulate it to create the html version
does that work in a .md?  can I have all the lines I would in an HTML?

ChatGPT said:

Yes — that works.

A .md file can contain:

Standard Markdown syntax.

Inline HTML (GitHub, Obsidian, and most renderers support this).

HTML comments (<!-- … -->) to “hide” sections from rendering.

So your plan is sound:

Write one master .md file.

Include YAML-style metadata at the top, but comment it out with <!-- … --> so it doesn’t get parsed.

Mix Markdown and HTML as needed. Anything you’d normally put in an .html file can live inside the .md (headings, links, <div>, <style>, etc.).

For live site publishing: remove the comments around the sections you want active, save/export it as .html, and GitHub Pages will serve it.

For Obsidian: leave the extra HTML/YAML commented so it doesn’t clutter your KB, but you can still see and edit it.

That way you only maintain one master source.

Do you want me to draft you a template master.md with:

Commented-out YAML header

A sample HTML <head> block

A Markdown nav section

Comment markers around optional sections

so you can copy it once and just toggle sections on/off?
