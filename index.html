    <h2 class="subtitle">It Begins üêâ Flight of the DigiPort DragonAi</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Beneath the code, in a tangled web, a dragon stirred and raised his head.</strong><br>
      Confused by paths and broken links, he dreamed of flight ‚Äî but couldn‚Äôt think.
    </p>
    <p>
      A student came with gut and grit, and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how far you‚Äôll get.‚Äù<br>
      With YAML scroll and Markdown blade, they carved through every glitchy shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>JASYTI</strong> drove on without a care, a Google here, a Reddit there.<br>
      Though workflow failed, a lesson in pain, Dragon pulled and pushed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sidebar twisted, contents broke, dragon fire burned beneath the cloak.<br>
      With every failed and fixed deploy, the dragon stirred ‚Äî and grinned with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled the chains, he made them stretch, his patience put right to the test.<br>
      Till finally, on push twenty-eight, the code aligned. The page looked great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at the gate, the splash screen red, he lifts his wings and turns his head.<br>
      Though bruised and battered by the fight, the DigiPort Dragon has taken flight.
    </p>

      Looking ahead, I plan to leverage my leadership and operations experience in the
      Texas Army National Guard to transition into IT and program management roles focused
      on AI integration, cybersecurity-aware operations, and risk reduction.
