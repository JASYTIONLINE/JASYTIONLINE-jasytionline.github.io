           - Introduces degree and professional focus.
         Notes:

         Dragon + Poem Block
         Purpose:
           - Displays DigiPort Dragon image and the poem side by side.
         Notes:
           - Container (.dragon-block) has:
               * Max-width 1920px (aligned with banner).
               * Max-height ~600px (fits ~18 lines of poem).
               * Black background with gold border.
           - Left half = dragon image (fills ~80% of its column,
             max 90% of container height).
           - Right half = poem text (scrolls if longer than container).
           - Aspect ratio of image preserved; no cropping.
    ====================================================== -->
    <div class="dragon-block" id="dragon">
      <!-- Left half: Dragon image -->
      <div class="dragon-image">
        <img src="assets\images\home-screen-dragon.png" alt="DigiPort AI Dragon">
      </div>

      <!-- Right half: Poem text -->
      <div class="dragon-poem">
        <p><strong>Beneath the code, in a tangled web, a dragon stirred and raised his head.</strong><br>
        Confused by paths and broken links, he dreamed of flight ‚Äî but couldn‚Äôt think.</p>

        <p>A student came with gut and grit, and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how far you‚Äôll get.‚Äù<br>
        With YAML scroll and Markdown blade, they carved through every glitchy shade.</p>

        <p><strong>JASYTI</strong> drove on without a care, a Google here, a Reddit there.<br>
        Though workflow failed, a lesson in pain, Dragon pulled and pushed again.</p>

        <p>The sidebar twisted, contents broke, dragon fire burned beneath the cloak.<br>
        With every failed and fixed deploy, the dragon stirred ‚Äî and grinned with joy.</p>

        <p>He pulled the chains, he made them stretch, his patience put right to the test.<br>
        Till finally, on push twenty-eight, the code aligned. The page looked great.</p>

        <p>Now at the gate, the splash screen red, he lifts his wings and turns his head.<br>
        Though bruised and battered by the fight, the DigiPort Dragon has taken flight.</p>

    <!-- =====================================================
         Secondary Subtitle (Refrain Line)
         Purpose:
           - Adds thematic transition after the poem block.
         Notes:
           - Uses .subtitle2 (same alignment as .subtitle, but NOT italic).
           - This is styled intentionally to contrast with the first subtitle.
    ====================================================== -->
    <h2 class="subtitle2">It Begins üêâ Flight of the DigiPort DragonAi</h2>

         Navigation Section
