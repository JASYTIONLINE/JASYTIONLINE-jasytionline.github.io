# CMPA 3301 ‚Äì Professional Project Repository
*For quick reference: this section gives a professional overview of the project
at a glance.*

A structured repository for **CMPA 3301 ‚Äì Fundamentals of Computing
Applications**.  
This course is the entry point for developing as a **hybrid technical worker** ‚Äî
a creative problem-solver who is comfortable with technology, understands
business principles, and can manage projects effectively.  
This project demonstrates those fundamentals through version control, structured
documentation, and live web publishing.

## üåê Live Links
*For access: this section provides direct links to the live site and repository.*

- Website:
  [https://jasytionline.github.io/JASYTIONLINE-jasytionline.github.io/](https://jasytionline.github.io/JASYTIONLINE-jasytionline.github.io/)  
- Repository:
  [https://github.com/JASYTIONLINE/JASYTIONLINE-jasytionline.github.io](https://github.com/JASYTIONLINE/JASYTIONLINE-jasytionline.github.io)

## üìå Highlights
*For context: this section lists key features and requirements covered by the
project.*

- Public repo with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `README.md`.  
- Published live website using GitHub Pages.  
- At least three commits with descriptive messages.  
- Organized using intentional rules of structure (demonstrating classification).  

## Repository Structure and Publishing Notes

This repository is designed to support two workflows:

1. **Local Knowledge Base (Obsidian)**  
   - Each folder contains an `index.md` file.  
   - These Markdown files provide internal navigation inside Obsidian and serve as documentation for project organization.  
   - They are not intended to be rendered as web pages.

2. **Public Website (GitHub Pages)**  
   - GitHub Pages requires an `index.html` at the root of the repository (and in any subfolders meant to be public).  
   - Only folders containing `index.html` files will display styled content on the live site.  
   - CSS and other assets (e.g., `/script/style.css`) are linked within the HTML to provide styling.

**Rule of Thumb:**  
- Use `index.md` for documentation and navigation.  
- Use `index.html` for public-facing web content on `https://<username>.github.io`.  

This dual structure allows the repository to function both as a professional portfolio site and as a private knowledge base for project development.

# Academic Detail (Scroll Zone)
*For deep divers: this section contains detailed explanations, theory, and
rubric alignment.*

## Purpose
*For alignment: explains the academic intent of the project in PMI-compliant
language.*

This repository supports all work required for:  
> **Early Fall 2025 ‚Äî TTU Online Computing Applications (CMPA-3301-D01)**  

It demonstrates the difference between categorization and classification by
applying explicit rules for file assignment, ensuring **systematic and
intentional organization** in line with Week 5 learning outcomes.

## Classification vs. Categorization
*For clarity: distinguishes between informal categorization and systematic
classification.*

- **Categorization** = informal grouping, ad hoc, flexible but inconsistent.  
- **Classification** = rule-based, consistent, systematic, and
  intentional:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

This repo uses **classification** through G-3 mapping, where each folder has a
defined function and rule of assignment. Drafts never appear in Deliverables,
supporting docs remain distinct, and references are preserved as knowledge
assets.

## Structure (G-3 Staff Mapping)
*For organization: describes the rules of assignment and folder logic using
G-system mapping.*

| Section | Academic Role                    | Folder             | Military Role (G3-xx)                  |
|---------|----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| G-3/33  | Deliverables (final submissions) | `33-deliverables`  | Operations ‚Äì Current Ops (G3-33)       |
| G-3/35  | Workspace (drafts & builds)      | `35-workspace`     | Plans ‚Äì Future Ops (G3-35)             |
| G-3/37  | Knowledge (course references)    | `37-knowledge`     | Training & Readiness (G3-37)           |
| G-3/38  | Supporting Docs (audit trail)    | `38-supporting-docs` | Force Integration / Management (G3-38) |
| G-3/39  | MWR (personal learning)          | `39-mwr`           | Assessment & Lessons Learned (G3-39)   |


### Explanation of Sections
*For context: each section is named after a G-3 sub-directorate in the Army
staff system. The Army model provides a clear ‚Äúrule of assignment,‚Äù which is
why it works as a classification scheme here. Each academic folder inherits
the same intent as its military counterpart.*

#### üìÅ G-3/33 ‚Äì Deliverables (Final Output and Submission Archive)
**Army role:** G-3/33 Current Operations is responsible for executing and
publishing orders, FRAGOs, and operational documents.  
**Academic tie-in:** Deliverables are the final, polished outputs of this
course ‚Äî the equivalent of ‚Äúorders‚Äù in the academic environment. Each module
subfolder (e.g., `M5/`) contains work that has been executed and is ready for
submission. By rule, only final versions live here, never drafts. This makes
the classification intentional: all ‚Äúpublished orders‚Äù = deliverables.

#### üìÅ G-3/35 ‚Äì Workspace (Assignment Development and Drafting)
**Army role:** G-3/35 Future Operations handles planning and development of
near-term missions (24‚Äì96 hours out).  
**Academic tie-in:** Workspace holds in-progress drafts, HTML builds, and
experiments ‚Äî the ‚Äúplanning‚Äù environment. Nothing here is submitted directly,
just like how Future Ops produces plans that will later transition into
Current Ops. The classification rule: all drafts belong here until they are
finalized.

#### üìÅ G-3/37 ‚Äì Knowledge (Course-Specific References and Templates)
**Army role:** G-3/37 Training manages exercises, readiness, and doctrine.  
**Academic tie-in:** Knowledge holds training material, rubrics, syllabi, and
templates. These are stable references, not changing with each operation but
supporting all tasks. The classification rule: all training/reference content
belongs here.

#### üìÅ G-3/38 ‚Äì Supporting Docs (Documentation, Research, and Audit Trail)
**Army role:** G-3/38 often manages orders control and document routing ‚Äî
ensuring accuracy and maintaining the audit trail of operational products.  
**Academic tie-in:** Supporting Docs hold customer requests, business cases,
and annotated resources. They validate decision-making and provide a
justification trail. The classification rule: all process and audit materials
belong here, never mixed with deliverables.

#### üìÅ G-3/39 ‚Äì MWR (Personal Learning & Professional Development)
**Army role:** G-3/39 supports morale, welfare, and recreation activities,
fostering development beyond immediate mission requirements.  
**Academic tie-in:** MWR is your sandbox for enrichment: PMP prep, project
management learning, and curiosity-driven work. The classification rule:
content here is personal/professional development, separate from task-driven
course deliverables.

## Success Criteria
*For evaluation: lists measurable outcomes tied to rubric and PMI standards.*

- Repository is public and correctly named.  
- Contains required files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `README.md`).  
- Minimum three descriptive commits pushed via GitHub Desktop.  
- Live site functions correctly via GitHub Pages.  
- README clearly documents purpose, structure, and intentional classification.
