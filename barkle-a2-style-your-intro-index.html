<h2>It Begins  üêâ Flight of the DigiPort DragonAi<h2></h2>

**Beneath the code, in a tangled web, a dragon stirred and raised his head.**
Confused by paths and broken links, he dreamed of flight ‚Äî but couldn‚Äôt think.  

A student came with gut and grit, and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how far you‚Äôll get.‚Äù  
With YAML scroll and Markdown blade, they carved through every glitchy shade.  

**JASYTI** drove on without a care, a Google here, a Reddit there.  
Though workflow failed, a lesson in pain, Dragon pulled and pushed again.  

The sidebar twisted, contents broke, dragon fire burned beneath the cloak.  
With every failed and fixed deploy, the dragon stirred ‚Äî and grinned with joy.  

He pulled the chains, he made them stretch, his patience put right to the test.  
Till finally, on push twenty-eight, The code aligned. The page looked great.  

Now at the gate, the splash screen red, he lifts his wings and turns his head.  
Though bruised and battered by the fight, the DigiPort Dragon has taken flight.

      One thing about me is that I tend to overengineer everything I do. I was
      even tempted to comment out headers in the origional project HTML using `<!-- -->` tags,
      but I didn‚Äôt include that in my scope statement.

    <h2>But Now:</h2>
     <p>
         The boss gave us permission to make this our own page, so I am ramping things up a but.
         I have dug intothe MDN Web pages a little deeper and found a cool few little tricks like 
         "Center" to make my name centered in the banner on top of the page.

      Looking ahead, I plan to leverage my leadership and operations experience in the
      Texas Army National Guard to transition into IT and program management roles focused
      on AI integration, cybersecurity-aware operations, and risk reduction.
